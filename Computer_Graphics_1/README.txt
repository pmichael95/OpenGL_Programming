// 1 \\ -  INTRODUCTION
This project covers the fundamentals of OpenGL.
Through file I/O, I was tasked to handle input from a file.
Then, process said input and determine whether we're performing translational or rotational operations.
The application then draws the shapes based on the input passed in.
Refer to section 3 for usage instructions and for the various functions present.

// 2 \\ - FILE I/O + FORMATS
Bundled with this project, I have provided several sample input files.
In order for the application to process the input file, its name must be exactly: "input_a1.txt".
As such, to use any of the provided files please remove the extra wording and underscore.
If you wish to modify the name of the input file, please change it in the .cpp file as well.

// 3 \\ - USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
Upon launch, the application will place a camera on the Z-axis.
Its 'up' value is on the Y-axis, and it is pointing towards the origin.
As such, the shapes are generally drawn in such a way that you will be looking at them from above.
Below are controls detailed for convenience.

/ 3.1 \ - Arrow Keys
Arrow keys (left, down, right, up) are the way to 'move around' in the application.

/ 3.2 \ - Mouse Cursor
The mouse cursor is the reference point to rotate around the application.

/ 3.3 \ - Mouse Wheel
Using the mouse wheel to scroll in/out of the application is supported.

/ 3.4 \ - Keys: 'P', 'L', and 'F'
These keys will change the display mode for the drawn shape.
P: Points
L: Lines
F: Filled (default)

// 4 \\ - FINAL REMARKS
The application fully supports translational shapes as well as rotational shapes.
Some sample files are provided, but feel free to create your own!

Thank you for reading!
Enjoy :)
